# Real Time Bus Tracker
This is a map of all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. To run it, click the button in the upper left.

Improvements made:
- New map styling
- Changed wording on button

Planned/future improvements:
- Adding bus times and delays
- Providing alternative routes given other parameters (I need to go to the coffee shop in between these locations, etc)
